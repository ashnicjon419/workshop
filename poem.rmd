The way the universe sat waiting to become,

quietly, in the nether of space and time,

you too remain some cellular snuggle

dangling between my legs, curled in the warm

swim of my mostly quietest self. If you come to be—

And who knows?—I wonder, little bubble

of unbudded capillaries, little one ever aswirl

in my vascular galaxies, what would you think

of this world which turns itself steadily

into an oblivion that hurts, and hurts bad?
